      <description>Overview This is an attack scenario designed to support incident response and investigation tabletop exercises. Mitigations and detection possibilities are called out at each stage, so you can begin the exercise at any point in the narrative. Whether you then use the previous actions to provide additional context and highlight gaps in detection, or continue the scenario on depending on the actions and responses of participants, is entirely up to you.</description>
