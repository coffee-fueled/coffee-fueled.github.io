[{"categories":null,"contents":"Overview This is an attack scenario designed to support incident response and investigation tabletop exercises. Mitigations and detection possibilities are called out at each stage, so you can begin the exercise at any point in the narrative. Whether you then use the previous actions to provide additional context and highlight gaps in detection, or continue the scenario on depending on the actions and responses of participants, is entirely up to you.\nAny actions by the attacker can be automated in a genuine attack. While this scenario is generic and hypothetical, all of the techniques used are ones I have seen exploited to great effect in real life scenarios.\nYou will find here:\n a timeline of the attack with actions by the attacker, employees, and indications of where the incident may be detected before the scenario completes a more detailed explanation of each stage on the timeline suggestions for injects at each point to provide more information to participants in response to the right investigative actions being taken the above as a downloadable PDF  While this is designed to be as generic and applicable as possible, certain assumptions have to be made. This scenario assumes:\n users can remotely login to email a filesharing platform is available and stores sensitive data internal users are connected to an unsegregated internal network  If some of these do not apply, or if you want to narrow the scenario, ignore those injects and activities. You may decide to start the scenario at the end, with the ransom demand being displayed to employees across the network, in which case the previous actions can help guide investigations. Otherwise, start at whichever point you realistically feel the alarm would be raised - the further events can be used to add pressure and identify holes in your incident response plan, if the right actions are not taken or the right questions not asked.\nDetection and prevention boxes on the timeline are not comprehensive or authoritative. The detailed summary of each stage below goes into more detail about possible detection/prevention mitigations, along with explanations of information might be available from any alerting solutions.\nScenario Initial incident User receives a phishing e-mail. After clicking the link, they are asked to sign in to a page that appears to be the same as your collaboration platform.\nPotential injects at this point:\n if user behaviour analytics are in use, overnight an out of character login by the user raises an alert if data loss prevention is available on the cloud platform, suspicious download activity is detected if malware detection is enabled on the cloud platform, a malicious file is detected on upload on their return to work the next day, the user discovers their credentials are not working  Overnight the attacker makes use of the credentials to download sensitive data from the filesharing platform, download the company address book, read through the user\u0026rsquo;s email history, and upload a malicious PDF file to the filesharing site.\n ","permalink":"https://coffee-fueled.github.io/resources/phishing_scenario/","tags":["incident response","scenario","phishing"],"title":"Attack Scenario: Phishing to Ransom"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Doorstep Dispensaree There are a few lessons to pull out of this case, but for those who want to look at the details themselves the full ICO penalty notice is available from their website.\nThe ICO identified a number of failings after they were called in by the MHRA, who had found some curious containers while executing a search warrant for their own investigation. In a courtyard behind the premises they found:\n-47 unlocked crates -2 disposal bags -1 cardboard box These unsecured containers, stored outside, contained around half a million documents – some water damaged – with personal information including medical and prescription information dating from 2016-2018. Shortly after they were informed, the Commissioner sent a request for additional information, a list which will be familiar to anyone who has banged their head against GDPR enough: data retention and disposal policies, privacy notice, explanation of why some data had been retained since 2016 and was stored in this way, and various other standard bits of evidence.\nIn response Doorstep Dispensaree did not cover themselves in glory by denying knowledge of the matter. Things escalated when they then refused to answer questions following a second request, apparently confusing the ICO and MHRA investigations. After an Information Notice was issued requiring the information, then appealed and upheld, they provided about half of the information claiming protection under the DPA 2018 that providing the rest would expose them to prosecution by the MHRA.\nAs part of their documentation, they did kindly provide the National Pharmacy Association template Data Protection Officer Guidance and Checklist, and Definitions and Quick Reference Guide. Other documents did not mention the GDPR, and the template were the original templates from the National Pharmacy Association.\nLessons In all Doorstep Dispensary were found to have contravened Articles 5, 13, 14, 24 and 32 to some degree or another. It’s a good thing for them that no information was stolen, as the ICO would have been unlikely to look on them kindly if anything had happened – especially as given the serious compliance failures it is unlikely any notification of the breach would have been forthcoming until the MHRA investigation flagged it up, and certainly not within the required 72 hours.\nYou cannot delegate responsibility for data you control\nDoorstep Dispensaree failed to dispose of the data securely, fairly clearly as some of it dated from 2016. An attempt was made to have the penalty assigned to a waste disposal company, blaming them for not having picked up the waste, which the ICO dismissed. While no evidence that the company was contracted was provided, Doorstep Dispensaree also failed to implement their own claimed shredding procedures, and in any case as the data controller they are ultimately accountable for the breach.\nInformation security is more than just confidentiality\nApparently storing sensitive personal information in unlocked boxes in an accessible yard is not considered secure storage or processing. As this is fairly obvious, the main point of interest here is that the ICO picked up on water damage to the documents being another failing. In information security terminology, there was a failure to ensure integrity and availability along with confidentiality. There is more to information security than simply locking data away.\nPolicies do not work retroactively\nThe ICO commented that eventually Doorstep Dispensaree did provide a more comprehensive set of policies. Unfortunately many were still in template form and had been acquired as a response to the investigation. The lesson here is that once an investigation has started, it’s probably too late to start downloading policy templates – best to put a framework in place beforehand.\nOnly keep data that needs to be kept\nWhile the ICO were generous enough to only consider on-going infringement from May 2018, they remarked that the age of the data caused some concern about retention.\nBe clear on your privacy notice\nYour privacy notice requires you to state who the controller is and how to contact them, the nature of the processing and the basis (and with special category data the additional basis for processing), the categories of personal data you collect and work with, all parties involved in the processing of data, how long it is retained, the rights of the data subjects, and where personal data is collected. It must also be written in clear, unambiguous language and be freely available to data subjects.\nA GDPR breach does not require that data has been lost or stolen\nWhat’s particularly interesting about this case compared to many of the headlines about cyber-related data protection incidents, is that no data was stolen. The fact that it could have led to distress and damage to individuals is sufficient.\nTrying to improve counts\nThe improvements Doorstep Dispensaree claims to be making have been taken into account, even though some of the policy documents presented are still in template format.\nIf you are found in breach, co-operate\nIt is very clear that the lack of early co-operation did more to hurt than help Doorstep Dispensaree’s case. Later co-operation and attempts to improve were taken into account, and the original proposed penalty of £400 000 was finalised as £275 000.\n","permalink":"https://coffee-fueled.github.io/blog/doorstep_dispensaree/","tags":["ico","gdpr fine","data protection"],"title":"Doorstep Dispensary"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml ``` [outputs] home = [\u0026ldquo;HTML\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;JSON\u0026rdquo;] ```\nSearching additional fields To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category ``` \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;contents\u0026rdquo;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026ldquo;tags\u0026rdquo;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026ldquo;categories\u0026rdquo; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, \u0026hellip; ```\nEdit fuse.js options to Search static/js/search.js ``` keys: [ \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;contents\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;tags\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;categories\u0026rdquo; ] ```\n","permalink":"https://coffee-fueled.github.io/search/","tags":null,"title":"Search Results"}]
